   "description": "Free Plug-in under MIT License, which means it is free for everyone to use, no matter if for commercial or private use. The UC Interactive Grid - Add Button plug-in is a simple way to add buttons to the Interactive Grid. Whether it's the toolbar, the actions menu, the row actions menu, or the row selection menu, this plug-in allows you to extend all of these components with your own, highly customizable buttons, declaratively. The plug-in's settings give you fine control over the button position (first, last, index), look, icon, and which action should be executed when that button is clicked. You can execute a predefined action (i.e., delete row), execute some JavaScript code, trigger an event, put the currently selected row(s) pk value into a page item, or even provide your own actions.",
